# alTooltip
WoW addon - Tooltip styling - Original by Allez. Using modified version via MonoUI, and updated it to be 9.0 (Shadowlands) compatible.

NOTE!: This is a modifed version of the original addon, to work with the MonoUI addon. I have splitted out the MonoUI version from the rest of the Mono UI package.

-- Original author: Allez
-- Forked download location: https://github.com/Allez/alTooltip
-- Original source code file: MonoUI bundled version downloaded from https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info18071-MonoUI.html#other -> Version 10.9.5
-- Source code file author: Monolit
-- This sourcecode is modified to make it compatible/errorfree with the 9.0 version of World of Warcraft (Shadowlands).

I am passively maintaining this addon, to get rid of errors when a new patch is updated.

Most recent changes are made to the backdrop changes made with the 9.0 patch.
